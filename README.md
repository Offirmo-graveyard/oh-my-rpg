Introduction
------------

I'm a great fan of RPGs. This is my pet project.

Presentation
------------

This is a framework for making a story-driven RPG.

Design principles : Story first. Mobile first. Offline first.

While playing a lot of mobile/desktop/console/navigator RPGs, I have found that no 2D/3D graphical engine
was really needed for a great story. While such an engine can be added, this framework focus only
on screens advancing a story along basic game features : character creation, inventory, levels, etc.

I've also found that navigator games suffer from their terrible, mandatory registration process.
Instead, this framework features a "play immediately, register painlessly later" approach.

I'm writing some games myself with this framework (links to come) but for explanatory purpose, I'll set up
a World Of Warcraft inspired demo showing the base features. (coming soon)

Commands
--------

`npm run i` install all dependencies
`npm run s` launch a server (debug, livereload)
